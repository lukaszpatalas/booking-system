      <h1>Why Makaton</h1>

      <h2>A Universal Communication Tool</h2>
      <p>
        Makaton is a unique language program that uses symbols, signs, and speech to enable everyone to communicate. 
        It supports children and adults with communication needs to express themselves effectively. Makaton gives a 
        voice to those who struggle with verbal communication, making it an empowering tool for individuals from all walks of life.
      </p>

      <h2>Bridging the Gap in Communication</h2>
      <p>
        Not everyone can communicate using traditional language methods, and this can result in feelings of isolation, 
        frustration, and misunderstanding. Makaton bridges this gap, providing a simple and effective way for everyone to 
        express their thoughts, needs, and emotions. It's not just about communication â€“ it's about connection.
      </p>

      <h2>A Multimodal Approach</h2>
      <p>
        Makaton uses a multimodal approach to communication, combining speech, signs, and symbols. This makes it a 
        flexible tool that can be tailored to individual needs. Whether you're a parent, carer, educator, or someone who wants 
        to improve their communication skills, Makaton provides a valuable resource for connecting on a deeper level.
      </p>

      <h2>Enhancing Language Development and Cognitive Skills</h2>
      <p>
        Makaton isn't just for those who have difficulty with speech. It's a valuable tool for enhancing language 
        development in children, improving cognitive skills, and supporting the learning of new languages. It's also a useful 
        tool for teaching people of all ages about the value of inclusive communication.
      </p>
